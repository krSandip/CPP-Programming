# C++ Programming â€“ My Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my **C++ programming tutorials and assignments** that I completed while learning the language.  
It reflects my **step-by-step learning process** and showcases how I built my programming skills through consistent practice.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### ðŸ”¹ Tutorials (Concept Learning)
The `tutorial/` folder contains topic-wise programs that helped me understand the core concepts of C++:

- **c1basics** â†’ Learned the basics of C++ (syntax, variables, operators, input/output).  
- **c2statements** â†’ Practiced conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch-case`).  
- **c3loops** â†’ Explored loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to repeat tasks.  
- **c4functions** â†’ Implemented user-defined functions, recursion, and scope concepts.  
- **c5patterns** â†’ Wrote pattern printing programs to improve logical thinking.  
- **c6arrays** â†’ Worked on 1D & 2D arrays and their applications.

### ðŸ”¹ Assignments (Practice & Skill Building)
The `assignment/` folder contains practice exercises where I applied the concepts I learned:  

- **assignment-1** to **assignment-8** â†’ Covers problems based on basics, statements, loops, functions, patterns, and arrays.  

Each assignment was an opportunity to strengthen my problem-solving ability.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Repository Shows
- I have **learned C++ from scratch** through practical coding.  
- I can **apply concepts** like loops, functions, and arrays in real programs.  
- My **logical thinking and problem-solving skills** improved by solving assignments.  
- This repository highlights my **dedication and consistency** in learning programming.

## ðŸš€ How I Practiced
1. Studied a concept.  
2. Wrote example programs under `tutorial/`.  
3. Solved problems in `assignment/` to test my understanding.
